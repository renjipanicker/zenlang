=======
This project is a thin C++ platform independent library which includes GUI abstraction for Win32, Gtk, Qt, OSX and iOS.
It also includes a code generator for writing statically-typed functional programming code using C++.

Here is a basic code sample:
public function (int ri, string rs)runFunctionTest(const int& x) abstract {
    unused(x);
    return (67890, "run");
}
